This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### ide
- vscode
#### react
- ~~
#### 협업도구
- notion
    - repository : https://www.notion.so/0dcf5ff7bda446b68f3bfacd9cc47880?v=e624d0e95ace45b6b29805434e2a1be7
    - 작업 과정
        1. pm은 칸반보드의 todo 리스트에 업무를 할당함
        2. 각 작업자는 in Progress에 할당받은 업무를 이동시킴. 그리고 property에 종료 날짜를 기록함

- git
    - source tree 3.0.8
    - git bash
    - 커밋 메세지
        - [무엇을]-어떻게
    - 커밋 전략
        1. 각 멤버들이 local develop에 작업 커밋
        2. 해당 멤버가 origin develop으로 pull request 날림
        3. 모든 멤버들이 해당 request에 코멘트를 남김
        4. 모든 멤버들의 확인이 끝나면 pm이 develop에 풀 땡김
        5. 참고로 master는 개발 완료 후 운영을 시작하면 운영할 예정
